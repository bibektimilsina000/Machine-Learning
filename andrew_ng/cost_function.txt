Cost function is used for error calculation in the ML model.

J(w,b)  =  1/2m (sum(i=1 to i=m) (ÿi-yi)^2 )



Gredient decent algorithm used to find value of w and b for minimum value of J

formula for Gredient decent


repeate untill convergence :

    w =   α - d/dw J(w,b)
    b =   α - d/db J(w,b)

should perform update of both w and b simultaniously



if 

where α = Learning rate

if α is too small:
    Gredient decent will be too slow.
if α is too Large :
    Gredient decent may 
        - overshoot , never reach the minimum.
        - Failed to converge , diverge
