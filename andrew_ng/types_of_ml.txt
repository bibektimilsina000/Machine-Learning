Supervised Machine Learning
    - Learns from being given "Right answers"


    *   Regression - predict many numbers , infinitly many possible outputs

    *   Categorical or Classes - predict categories , small number of possible outputs

Supervised Machine Learning
    - Data only comes with label x,but no input label y.
      algorithm has to find structure in the data.



    - Find something in the unlabled data

    - Clustering
        Grouping similar datapoints together

    - Anomaly detection
        Finds unusual datapoints.
    - Dimensionality reduction
        Compress data using fewer numbers.
